**Purpose:**

- **pipenv:** Primarily focuses on **dependency management** for Python projects. It creates and manages virtual environments, but its core strength lies in handling dependencies with tools like `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` for reproducibility.
- **virtualenv:** A lightweight tool designed specifically to create isolated **virtual environments** for Python projects. It doesn't handle dependency management directly.
- **conda:** A broader package and environment manager primarily used for scientific computing in Python. It can manage Python environments, but also handles packages for other languages like R.

**Dependency Management:**

- **pipenv:** Integrates dependency management with virtual environments. It uses `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` to specify and lock down dependencies for deterministic builds.
- **virtualenv:** Requires separate tools like `pip` for dependency management after creating the virtual environment.
- **conda:** Can manage dependencies for various languages alongside Python packages. It uses its own package repository system.

**Complexity:**

- **pipenv:** Offers a more streamlined experience for managing both dependencies and virtual environments, but it might have a slightly steeper learning curve compared to `venv`.
- **virtualenv:** Very simple to use, ideal for quickly creating isolated Python environments.
- **conda:** More complex due to its broader functionality for managing various languages and packages.

**Target Users:**

- **pipenv:** Well-suited for developers who prioritize managing dependencies and ensuring reproducible builds in Python projects.
- **virtualenv:** A good choice for beginners or when you only need basic virtual environment isolation for Python projects.
- **conda:** Commonly used in scientific computing and data analysis workflows involving Python and other languages.

**In summary:**

- **Choose pipenv** if you prioritize managing dependencies and reproducibility in your Python projects.
- **Choose virtualenv** for a simple and lightweight solution to create isolated Python environments.
- **Choose conda** if you work in scientific computing or need to manage packages for multiple languages alongside Python.

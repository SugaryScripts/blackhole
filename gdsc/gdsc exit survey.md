I encounter challenges in fostering enthusiasm among the members and maintaining strong connections with the core team, particularly in online settings. Despite gathering ideas from other universities, implementing them proves to be difficult. I aspire to establish a step-by-step approach that brings me closer to each member of GDSC, as closer connections enable active discussions during live events.

Protect your privacy, do not include personal information in your response.
```
Motivating other university students as a community can be challenging. However, it is a learning process that requires continuous effort. Especially when the leads are introvert and lack of confident. Having a graduate lead is one of the necessary forms of support. So i might need some idea that encourage the lead that have been graduated to support the community or next lead.

To assume a leadership role in a club, there are specific criteria that need to be met. One of these requirements is not being below the 6th semester. However, in the case of GDSC (Google Developer Student Clubs), the minimum requirement is set at the 7th semester. This presents a challenge in deciding which rule to flex and considering the potential consequences.

##### **Solution Challenge**

###### Did you participate in the 2023 Solution Challenge?
Yes
No

###### If not, why?
Protect your privacy, do not include personal information in your response.
```
At my university, I struggle to attract a sufficient number of participants due to a lack of enthusiasm. This is particularly challenging since it is not yet officially integrated into the university program to gain poin social (universities point as part of graduation criteria at certain number), limiting the number of interested students. Additionally, balancing time management and commitment while dealing with college responsibilities adds another layer of enthusiasm. Yet we've successfully acquired one team. And as a single team, maintaining resilience and staying connected, especially in an online setting, has proven to be a challenge in completing project submissions successfully.

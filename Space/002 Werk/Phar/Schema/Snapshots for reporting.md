Ah, I see! You're referring to situations where product attributes—like **color**, **material**, **size**, or **power**—are **dynamic** and can change over time, and you want to store these attributes in a snapshot without causing issues with deleted or modified data. When attributes are not static and can vary per product or variant, we need to consider how to capture and preserve them in a way that doesn't depend on the changing structure of the product attributes.

Here's how you can handle this scenario:

### 1. **Store Attributes as Key-Value Pairs**

The key idea is to store each product's attributes as **key-value pairs** in the snapshot. This approach allows you to capture the **dynamic** nature of the attributes without needing to define a fixed structure for them. Each snapshot record can store the attributes of a product or variant at the time of the transaction as a collection of key-value pairs.

#### Key Changes:

- **Dynamic Attributes**: Instead of having fixed columns for attributes (e.g., `color`, `size`, `power`), you use a flexible structure (such as a JSON column or a key-value pair table) to store attributes dynamically.
- **Capture Attribute Values at Transaction Time**: When a transaction happens, you capture the **actual values** of the dynamic attributes in the snapshot, so even if those attributes change later, the historical snapshot will still reflect the correct state for that transaction.

### 2. **Approach with Key-Value Store in Snapshots**

You can use a table structure that allows storing the **product attributes dynamically** as key-value pairs, either as columns or in a related table. Here's an example of both approaches:

#### Option 1: **Store Dynamic Attributes in a JSON Column**

A simple and efficient way to store dynamic attributes is using a **JSON** column in the snapshot table. This lets you store a flexible set of attributes without needing to define each attribute as a column in the table.

##### Snapshot Table Example with JSON Column:

sql

Copy code

```sql
CREATE TABLE transaction_snapshots (     
snapshot_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,     
transaction_id INT,     
product_id INT,     
variant_id INT,     
price DECIMAL(10, 2),     
product_type_name VARCHAR(255),       -- Product type (e.g., "Lens", "Frame")     
brand_name VARCHAR(255),              -- Brand name (e.g., "Ray-Ban")     
variant_name VARCHAR(255),            -- Variant (e.g., "Red", "Medium")     
attributes JSON,                      -- JSON column to store dynamic attributes     
transaction_date DATETIME,     
created_at DATETIME );
```

##### Example Data (with dynamic attributes stored in JSON):

|snapshot_id|transaction_id|product_id|variant_id|price|product_type_name|brand_name|variant_name|attributes|transaction_date|created_at|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|1001|1|1|120.00|Frame|Ray-Ban|Red|{"Color": "Red", "Material": "Metal", "Size": "Medium"}|2024-11-26 10:00:00|2024-11-26 10:00:00|
|2|1002|2|2|70.00|Lens|Acuvue|-4.00|{"Power": "-4.00", "UV Protection": true}|2024-11-26 10:05:00|2024-11-26 10:05:00|
|3|1003|3|3|150.00|Frame|Oakley|Blue|{"Color": "Blue", "Material": "Plastic", "Size": "Large"}|2024-11-26 10:10:00|2024-11-26 10:10:00|

#### How this works:

- The **attributes** column is a JSON object that contains a collection of key-value pairs representing the dynamic attributes of the product variant at the time of the transaction.
- If a product has attributes like **Color**, **Material**, and **Size**, they are stored as key-value pairs in the `attributes` column.
- If a new attribute (e.g., "Weight") is added or removed in the future, you can simply modify the JSON structure without altering the database schema.

#### Pros of this approach:

- **Flexibility**: You can store any number of attributes without needing to change your schema.
- **Easily Extendable**: New attributes can be added in the future without requiring schema changes.
- **Preserved History**: Even if attributes change in the future, the snapshot will preserve the correct values at the time of the transaction.

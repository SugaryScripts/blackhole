*** Recruiting both will give you the Hate/Hate Relationship achievement  
****** Tip: Despite hating each other, it is possible that recruiting one and  
immediately recruiting the other can result in the first recruited  
companion telling you they are worried about the other's performance  
which can result in them training/giving the other the Second-Line trait.  
Ex: Rec. Heleth > Rec. Gunbald > Heleth gives Gunbald Second-Line Trait  
  
I haven't fully explored Drombach yet so there may be more 'unique' companions I'm missing. Also possible I forgot other companions from the other regions.

##### Stats
- **Profession** - Master Tinkerer (+12 Critical Hit Chance), Master Alchemist (+10 Dexterity), or Master Thief (+4 Dexterity, +6% Critical Hit Chance)  
- **Aptitude Points** - raise base Willpower to 12/14, 16~20 base movement (or DLC 18~24 base movement) & remainder into critical hit

##### Strategy

- The main strength of this build is to kill 2 high value targets from afar or kill 1 & maim the other so that target remains out of reach of your team.  
- Marksman's **Aimed Shot** does more damage but costs 1 more VP, making it useful early game when damage is not enough to kill. Reaching late game & properly equipped, **Aimed Shot** becomes a penalty as the extra VP cost is wasted overkill. No point killing an enemy with 2K damage when 1K is enough.  
- This is growth build, you can start with level 3 Hunter. However, you will need at least level 8 to output enough damage to kill targets.  
- Use **Aim** & the weapon skill (**Volley of Arrows**) to take out the enemy leader or high damage target. Then use **Recoil Shot** to kill or prevent the next target from reaching your team.  
- Choosing between **Lone Wolf** or **Second Weapon** is a bit of a toss up: Do you want more utility with 2 weapons of different skills or do you want a little bit more damage when archer is far from your main force? A good candidate for the alternate weapon is **The Indomitable One**. Higher **Dexterity**, knockback on **critical hit** for all enemies in a line is quite handy to kill more or stall longer.  
- This build can exceed 100% critical hit chance. If you are confident in your luck, you can swap out your items to maintain 80% critical hit chance & squeeze out a bit more range with the +1 range amour for a total of 12 range (24 range when used with **Deftness**).

- **Aptitude Points** - raise base Willpower to 12/14, 16~20 base movement (or DLC 18~24 base movement) & remainder into critical hit

##### Strategy

- This build is better for larger fights to cover 1 side while dealing with enemies on another side.  
    
- Use basic attack from bow, then setup **Barrage** over the enemies' approach. Early when damage from AO not enough to kill, pair with a **Spearman** with **Team Spirit**.  
    
- Any legendary bow would have more dexterity & output more AO damage when on overwatch.  
    
- **Barrage** is not considered a shot attack, so penalties & buffs (eg.: **Precision**, +Range) do not apply to it.

- **Aptitude Points** - raise base Willpower to 12/14, 16~20 base movement (or DLC 20~24 base movement) & remainder into Strength

##### Strategy

- **This the only build that will always critical hit even without raising the critical hit stat.**  
- At level 8 with upgraded **Temperance** giving **Riposte** after taking 2 attacks.  
- The essential pieces are **Legionary's Ointment**, **Bleeding Oil**, **Bleeding Oil Concentrate** & **Alazarian Heater Shield**  
- Bleeding oil deals 20% of max hp (25% if **Path** upgraded)  
- Since we are not taking **Guard-Breaker**, **Perforating oil** is needed to negate enemy guard  
- **Overwhelming Presence** guarantees critical hits for every attack while engaged.  
- Use Horse layer to get max guard (80%) & swap out with Stag layer when over the guard cap for more armour to keep critical hits going longer.  
- Start the fight by activating anticoagulant weapon, focus on killing high value targets.  
- Use disengage to trigger AO after each strike.  
- Taunt & disengage to take less damage & trigger more AO. Best to prioritize taunt on a tank as will need several disengages to kill.  
- End turn by positioning adjacent to ranged melee units such as spearmen & axe throwers as they will still strike at melee range & trigger your AO.

- Use **Taunt** null damage taken on toughest target before starting.  
- Take **Temperance** over **Guard Breaker** if tanking is higher priority. Use **Perforating Oil** to make up for choosing **Temperance** at level 8 until getting it at level 12.  
- To use **Defensive Riposte** aggressively, use **Disengage** after each engagement for 50% chance AO strike. If **Defensive Riposte** fails to trigger, upgraded **Temperance** will counter with AO every 2 hits.

- **Aptitude Points** - raise base Willpower to 12/14, 16~20 base movement (or DLC 20~24 base movement) & remainder into critical hit

Strategy

- Early game, this unit will take part in more kills as average troop power is low. Late game, he can focus more on support & utility. **Valorous Victory** is better off early game, while **Valorous Support** late game. Adjust the build according to your team composition & play style.  
    
- **Inquisition Cinqueda** is great for killing leaders, elites, & targets that have a lot of buffs. However, the difference in damage between uncommon, rare & legendary daggers is very significant at later levels.  
    
- Use **Run** to break engagements or to reach new groups of enemies. Always pull behind friendly units as this build wont survive more than 3 hits with no guard.  
    
- Use all your manuals skills, they will trigger **Instinctive Throw** as long as enemy within range & reset your movement. The chip damage is great & bringing target health down to bag'em.  
    
- With fully upgraded gear, its easy to exceed 100% critical chance, swap out the extra critical chance for dexterity or other stats. Any critical chance above 100% is a waste of points.

- **Aptitude Points** - raise base Willpower to 12/14, 16~20 base movement (or DLC 18~22 base movement) & remainder into critical hit

##### Strategy

- This is a very VP intensive slaughter machine, Brave oil lets it be self-sufficient. It is most effective against groups of 2 or 3. It can kill every light & medium armoured enemies on the map by ownself. Heavy armoured enemies need to be softened by (1) engaged by another unit or (2) use active skills to proc **Instinctive Throw**.  
    
- Cold-Blooded is not taken because fighting alone stabbing faces will not proc it.  
    
- Every proc of upgraded **Instinctive Throw** resets movement, so chain targets properly then use **Frenzy** to kill.  
    
- **
    
    Extreme Difficulty
    
    **This build will need a large VP stored before starting. Alternatively, apply **Tactical Orders** first, then use VP skills with **Instinctive Throw** to setup chain kills will allow this build to actually be a VP generator.

- The main focus is on buffing allies or de-buffing enemies.

Stats

- **Profession** - Master Tinkerer (+12 Critical Hit Chance), Master Blacksmith (+10 Strength), or Master Woodcutter (+4 Strength, +6% Critical Hit Chance)  
    
- **Aptitude Points** - raise base Willpower to 12/14, 28 base movement & remainder into critical hit

Strategy

- This is a VP efficient battle opening build. Its also a viable attempt to use the weak legendary armour sets.  
    
- The key piece is the **Lord of the Sea's Prestige** effect to apply +20% damage taken to all enemies. Killing the Pirate Lord If destroying the helm to turn it into a stamp is not a barrier, rare medium armour sets are actually better.  
    
- The high requirement of 28 base movement is to make use of Mihr brooch to easily maintain CHC at >90% & also be able to pull back to safety.  
    
- Level 5 skills have no synergy with this build. **Team Spirit** is the best by supporting archers & other ranged units or choose any other skill to fit the overall strategy.  
    
- Start the fight by applying the improved **Last Push** on an ally. Apply Captain's skill **Galvanise Troops** if needed.  
    
- Target a cluster of enemies with **Controlled Whirlwind**. With 3 enemies its guaranteed kill, but with only 2 enemies, those with heavy armour & >50% guard may survive even with a full stack of delicious food buff.  
    
- Then **Taunt** any remaining survivors before using the weapon skill **Kill the Weak**.  
    
- With the skill rest on **Kill the Weak**, kill or damage another enemy before moving unit behind front line.

Stats

- **Profession** - Master Tinkerer (+12 Critical Hit Chance), Master Blacksmith (+10 Strength), or Master Woodcutter (+4 Strength, +6% Critical Hit Chance)  
    
- **Aptitude Points** - raise base Willpower to 12/14, 16~20 base movement (or DLC 20~24 base movement) & remainder into critical hit

Strategy

- This build starts at level 5 with **Counter-Strike**, getting it upgraded grants **Inspiration** that lets you strike at enemies further away, being able to focus down enemy **Leaders** & other high value threats  
    
- Start the fight another unit with Lieutenant to buff this unit if there is no imminent danger of taking AOE damage.  
    
- Engage a nearby unit with **Taunt** null damage taken, disenage to use AO from **Riposte**.  
    
- Use Legion Buckler skill **Motivating Blow** to buff self-damage & **Destabilizing Strike** to kill tanks faster.  
    
- Use **Taunt** null damage taken & to kill tanks faster.  
    
- From level 8, **Ludern swamps** & **Cursed Villages** become easy due to poison immunity from **Hardcore Training**.  
    
- End turn by positioning adjacent to ranged melee units such as enemy spearmen or axe throwers as they will engage at melee range & trigger your AO from **Enhanced Visibility**.

    Extreme Difficulty
    
    **Use another unit with Lieutenant skill first to double all VP gains.

    **At least 25 movement recommended before **Inspiration** to cross the bridge & engage nearest target.

_

This build has been radically changed by **Counter-Attack** nerf as it relied on having **Riposte** on every engagement prior to nerf and **Disengage**. However, It still functions well & can tuned into other builds from level 10.

Stats

- **Profession** - Master Tinkerer (+12 Critical Hit Chance), Master Blacksmith (+10 Strength), or Master Woodcutter (+4 Strength, +6% Critical Hit Chance)  
- **Aptitude Points** - raise base Willpower to 12/14, 16~20 base movement (or DLC 20~24 base movement) & remainder into critical hit

##### Strategy

- This build is optimized for solo play. Swap **Hardcore Training** for any of the other level 5 skills if **Bleeding**, **Poison** & **Burning** immunity is not needed.  
- The essential pieces are **Legionary's Ointment**, **Bleeding Oil**, **Bleeding Oil Concentrate** & **Alazarian Heater Shield**  
- Use Horse layer to get max guard (80%) & swap out with Rat layer when over the guard cap  
- This build is tougher than **The Iron Maiden**, but deals less damage due to lower critical hit chance  
- **Clink's Sword** procs bleed more times (up to 3), but last strike causes knock back. If your target isnt against a wall & you cant kill it, you lose 1 AO strike because of this.  
- Start the fight by activating **Anticoagulant Weapon**, focus on high value targets first.  
- Use Taunt to engage threat, then disengage to trigger AO. If **Defensive Riposte** fails, most AO recieved will do no damage due to **Bulwark**, **Taunt** & **Master Opportunist**.  
- End turn by positioning adjacent to ranged melee units such as enemy spearmen or axe throwers as they will still strike at melee range & trigger your AO.

This build is still able to kill 3 bears in 3 turns solo even though **Disengage** has been nerfed to ignore guard when receiving damage. Unlike the **Counter-Attack** variant which relied on having **Riposte** on every engagement prior to nerf.

##### Strategy

- Weapon - **Splitter** (Apply bloodshed DOT spread across all targets), or any 2H axe, _DLC>> **Enlil's Great Axe** (gain +1 Fervour for each unit hit, +1 more for critical hit)_

- **Aptitude Points** - raise base Willpower to 12/14, 18~22 base movement (or DLC 22~26 base movement) & remainder into critical hit

  

Strategy

- This build needs the level 8 **Challenging Shout** to work properly.  
    
- Move into a group of at least 3 targets & use **Challenging Shout** to pull them together then use **Cutting Maelstrom** to kill them all.  
    
- Hitting 3 targets with one of at least light armor guarantees can trigger **Fatal Blow** to kill all. If you are lucky (4 targets) or very lucky (5 targets), its guaranteed kill even if they are all heavy armoured.  
    
- Consider the enemies' positions as **Challenging Shout** will not have good effect if they block each other.  
    
- When fighting enemies with melee retaliation (Alazarian, Defender, Wrongdoer (poison)), move at least 0.5m away so the retaliatory strikes cant trigger.  
    
- Don't let this unit stay surrounded after fighting, pull back to safety otherwise will risk injury.  
    
- Higher movement allows for better positioning & hiding behind tanks, make full use of **Run** to move around.  
    
- If unable to run away, use **Taunt** to reduce damage taken

- **Aptitude Points** - raise base Willpower to 12/14, 18~22 base movement (or DLC 22~26 base movement) & remainder into critical hit

Strategy

- This is a variant of the **Axecutioner**, does more damage & is tougher. All the tactics above will apply.  
- Additionally, **Enhance Visibility** allows him to 1 shot any light & medium armoured melee attackers with AO in retaliation.  
- Be cautioned that when switching between 2H & 1H builds with the same character. There is a limit to the number of each trait that you can have in your party. Try to focus 1H or 2H without switching by getting a another character for each build to avoid locking up unused weapon traits(eg.: Tormentor, Giant, Duelist).  
- At 50% guard, he gains +25% damage & can also be an off-tank  
- **Extreme Difficulty
    **Use Brave Oil & Brave Oil Concentrate to return VP.  
    
- **DLC Ship fights

### Freed Prisoner

Freed prisoners are weaker as compared to main classees due to lack of skills. However, they have higher base stats especially when captured at higher levels. While prisoners are weak, they are not entirely useless.

- Shield - **Alazarian Heater Shield** (When hit by engaged opponent, retaliates with AO)

    _
- Belt - **Small Gauntlet** (+50% damage, can only use base action) or any other belt

Stats

- **Profession** - Master Tinkerer (+12 Critical Hit Chance), Master Blacksmith (+10 Strength), or Master Woodcutter (+4 Strength, +6% Critical Hit Chance)  
    
- **Aptitude Points** - raise base Willpower to 12/14, 16~20 base movement (or DLC 20~24 base movement) & remainder into critical hit

Strategy

- This build is optimized for to make a Wrongdoer build useful. Fanatic & Seafarer have higher damage output, but lack the party-wide buff the Wrongdoer has. Heavy armoured units in all of the factions can be used, but its still costlier than using a bear or polar bear to soak damage. It works better than a bear when dealing with multiple light & medium armoured enemies.  
    
- Combat is simple: Kill off a dying or light armoured unit, then position to intercept any melee enemies. It will deal 2 AO to any melee enemy that engages & can even kill heavy armoured ones if both AO deal critical hit.  
    
- Dont get too attached to this unit as base stats are higher on ones that are captured at higher level.  
    
- Belt slot is flexibile, while Small Gauntlet negates the weakness of lack of skills, use any belt that can complment your team strategy.  
    
- For Wrongdoer, it makes the party more effective the more companions in the party with at least 70% critical hit chance. Below that, its better to have brute or swordsman instead.

**Recommended Prisoner Class:** Any with high constitution  
**Best Choices:** Blocker (Tracker), Defender (Guard), Foot Soldier (Guard), Hothead (Legion), Legionary (Legion), Peacebearer (Brotherhood), Sentry (Inquisition), Wrongdoer (Bandit)  
_Note: Before party reaches level 12, use any prisoner with the goal to replace after party reaching level 12. This is because level 15 is the highest level that can be captured when party is level ≥12 & on extreme difficulty . These units have higher base stats when captured at higher levels._  
  
**Recommended starting Traits:** No trait, Brawny, Stocky, Hardworking, (or any negative combat trait to reduce chance of spawning on other potential units)  
_Note: Dismiss those with negative adventure traits glutton, pickpocket, lazy, loafer & drunkard before the party rests. Likewise, if there are good combat traits such as Strong, Nimble, etc on them, dismiss them as it reduces good trait spawn chance. While Brawny & Stocky are better reserved for Work Pony (~30%), min-max isnt necessary in this game._

FAQ

Why dont put aptitude stat points into Strength or Dexterity?

It may seem that putting main stat (strength or dexterity) is the way to go when starting a new game. However, that's a trap as end game weapons outshine using aptitude points.  
Its better to add critical hit, movement & willpower as there are very few sources that improve these.  
[![](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2321110410971492191/30AC63CF0C10D956BC5EC558F40AADA6D2C21E4E/)](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2321110410971492191/30AC63CF0C10D956BC5EC558F40AADA6D2C21E4E/)  
Example: 40 base strength

- + 80 strength from weapon = +200% effective improvement  
    
- + 20 strength from 10 levels = +50% effective improvement

Compared to 10% base critical hit chance or 10 base movement

- + 20 points from 10 levels = +200% effective improvement

Why dont put aptitude stat points into Constitution?

Constitution is useless to add because you get more effective hit points from armor & guard.  
  
Some maths:  
X% guard = Y% damage taken, which means 1 point of armor can take (D) points of raw damage, which means (AP) armor points is (EP) hit points effectively

- 50% guard, 50% damage taken, 1:2, 400 AP = 800 EP  
    
- 67% guard, 33% damage taken, 1:3, 400 AP = 1200 EP  
    
- 75% guard, 25% damage taken, 1:4, 400 AP = 1600 EP  
    
- 80% guard, 20% damage taken, 1:5, 400 AP = 2000 EP

100 ~ 200+ health from constitution is only worth 5~10% of total effective hit points.  
The only exception are animals since animals dont have guard.  
  

What does Willpower affect?

- At 15 or more WP, a character will resist death.  
    
- +1 to critical hit chance per point in WP  
    
- More total WP makes it easier to reach motivated, galvanised & scares enemy into fleeing.  
    
- More WP allows for smaller party size & number of times combat happens in cursed villages

Besides taking fatal damage from enemies, the resist death is helpful when character is trapped from avoiding instant death from rockfall or lightning strike.  
If the goal is to min-max stat points, leave WP at 11 or 12 since it is normal to get +4 for all companions from equipment, camp items & food (DLC).  
  

How to manage party size early game?

Keep party size ≤10 to avoid running out of funds & increase once able to provide:

- Damage dealers with the latest upgraded weapons  
    
- Tanks & Off tanks with the latest upgraded armors  
    
- Every one else getting weapons at their level

All the builds work well until a party size of 20, with a focus on more AOE, "sitting walls" & VP generators for bigger parties.  
  
One of the best starter classes early game is Ranger - Strategist. You can get it at level 2 & deals ~300% damage regularly by triggering other's AO. If you struggle to run your party financially, use bears or polar bears to take hits as they dont cost "repair" so long as their HP dont drop below 50%  
  

Characters' stats hired at higher levels better?

No, there is some variance but they are essentially the same, note that a character with 2 positive traits will usually have lower stats, eg. willpower.  
  
However for captured animals & prisoners, capturing at higher levels have better stats overall.  
Also, captured animals can go up to level 15, whereas normal leveling is capped at 13.  
[_Trivia: There was a bug in CU2 that allows capturing up to level <40 character which was removed in DLC update._](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1527950/discussions/0/3880472020698991984/)  
  

How to hire over level characters?

When encountering unique mercenaries on Adaptive mode, they will lock in at 100% of your party's average level as compared to normal tavern mercenaries (80%)  

Method 1:

Capture a beast or companion at higher levels (eg. L15) before entering the room that these unique mercenaries are in.  

Method 2:

Meet unique mercenaries in combat at higher difficulties when your party is at least level 12. _Only valid for Arthes Brute & Belerion Spearman._  
**Note: +2 levels on Expert up to level 14 or +3 levels on Extreme up to level 15**  
  

Is it worth putting Perforating Oil on a Fighter with Destabilizing Strike?

Early game its better to use another oil when there's not enough damage for that fighter to kill multiple targets. Late game, when its frequent to 1 & 2 shot all enemies, perforating oil is better as it is nett increase of:

- +13% more damage vs 20% guard  
    
- +21% more damage vs 30% guard  
    
- +50% more damage vs 50% guard  
    
- +200% more damage vs 80% guard

This means a lot in most of the higher level fights since its easy to pull off 5 or more strikes a turn through multiple skills: Weapon skill, Class skill, Wrath, Shield skill & multiple AO.

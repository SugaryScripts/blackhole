Alchemist

This profession enables you to brew useful concoctions and things to use during battle. You can start it in cities in Clinic with Pharmacy. Of course, as with the creation of equipment in the forge, you must first collect the right ingredients and recipes. This profession will add to your Dexterity.  
  
One unique aspect of the alchemist profession is their ability to reactivate rat nests. As far as we know, alchemists are the only ones capable of doing so. This is particularly useful for players who want to farm rat nests for loot.  
  
In addition, alchemists are essential for crafting higher-tier equipment. Without them, you won't be able to create some of the most powerful items in the game. Therefore, having at least one alchemist in your party is important.  
  
Aside from crafting equipment, alchemists can create potions and poisons that debuff enemies or buff allies. This makes them incredibly versatile on the battlefield.  
  

- Best for utility units like poisoners or strategists.  
    
- Offers additional Dexterity but has a weaker stat spread.  
    
- Alchemists can create potions and poisons that can debuff enemies or buff allies.

Angler

The name of this profession speaks for itself. If you assign it to a character, you will be able to catch fish in Fisheries or at special points on the water (you will recognize them by their lights). Of course, you also need fish hooks (you can make them in the Workshop).  
  
This profession gives a bonus to Willpower, and at higher levels also to Critical Hit. So give it to an Archer or a Scout.  
  
Fishing also requires you to complete a minigame. It is similar to many other fishing games. You can't let the marker leave the safe field.  
  

- Best for DPS units that focus on critical hit chance, like archers, cutthroat rangers, or melee DPS.  
    
- Anglers are skilled in finding and catching fish, which can be valuable resources.  
    
- Their fishing abilities can also provide buffs to the party.

Bard

This is a profession that requires a Workshop (Camp). In it you must create lutes, after unlocking the appropriate recipe, of course. Bard enables you to learn various songs, as long as you meet certain conditions. Once you learn them, you can later sing them in the Inn. This involves a mini-game - you have to press the buttons on the lute at the right time. It requires a lot of dexterity. You will get money and Influence for it. This profession will add to your Constitution  
  

- Suitable for off-tanking or tanking units like protectors or riposte duelists.  
    
- Provides extra Constitution and Willpower.

Blacksmith

One of the basic professions. To unlock it go to the forge and use the anvil. A character in this profession can make various pieces of equipment thanks to the materials you acquire along the way.  
  
An important aspect of the class is its bonus to Strength. So it is worthwhile for this profession to be performed by a character who focuses on fighting with two-handed weapons.  
  
Of course, you will not make the best items from the very beginning. As you progress in the game you will unlock recipes for items, which you can then make.  
  
Crafting is linked to a simple mini-game that involves clicking on highlighted items on the anvil. If you manage to make it perfectly, you will get items of better quality. It's worth keeping this in mind and saving the game before creating more valuable inventory items.  
  

- Recommended for melee units like brutes, spearmen, or warriors that scale off strength.  
    
- Provides additional Strength, though the stat spread is underwhelming.  
    
- Blacksmiths can craft and repair weapons and armor, improving the party's overall effectiveness.

Cook

Cook is another profession associated with the Camp. As the name suggests Prepares meals from raw ingredients. It is worth doing, as such food is more nutritious. To discover this profession you need to create a Cooking Pot in Workshop. This profession will increase your Constitution.  
  
  

- Ideal for dedicated tanks.  
    
- Provides a significant boost to Constitution.  
    
- Cooks can prepare food that grants buffs and heals the party.

Miner

In Wartales you can also find mines. And it is there that you will start the profession of a miner. It enables you to acquire valuable resources. A bonus from this profession goes to Constitution. However, at higher levels you also gain Strength.  
  
This profession is associated with the same minigame as chopping wood - you have to press the mouse button at the right moment.  
  

- Ideal for melee DPS or off-tanks.  
    
- Provides extra Constitution and Strength.  
    
- Miners can gather valuable ores and gems, which can be used to craft powerful items.

Scholar

The scholar profession is associated with Tombs, and allows players to study various codices using runes. With enough knowledge, scholars can create powerful items. To use this profession, players must create a Lectern in their camp using the workshop. The passive bonus from this profession is Willpower, which is particularly useful for support rangers or spearmen.  
  
Scholars are particularly adept at providing tactical advantages and support to the party. They excel at identifying weaknesses in enemies, which allows players to exploit them to their advantage. With their ability to create powerful items, scholars can also significantly boost the party's combat capabilities.  
  
One unique aspect of the scholar profession is their ability to help players obtain legendary weapons. Without a scholar, players will never be able to get their hands on some of the game's most powerful weapons.  
  
Additionally, scholars are currently the fastest way to earn Knowledge points. This is particularly true if players visit tombs for fragments and codices. Knowledge points are essential for unlocking new skills and abilities, so having a scholar in the party is a great way to ensure that players can continue to improve their characters over time.  
  
Overall, the scholar profession is an excellent choice for players who prioritize tactical advantages and support over raw strength. With their ability to create powerful items, identify enemy weaknesses, and earn Knowledge points quickly, scholars are an invaluable addition to any party.

- Recommended for high crit builds like damage archers, damage rangers, or DPS melee builds.  
    
- Tinkerers are skilled at creating and repairing gadgets, which can be useful in various situations.  
    
- They can also set traps and use gadgets for crowd control.

Thief

In the game, you will sometimes encounter various locked chests. You can open them, assuming you have a lockpick. You will craft it in the Workshop. This is connected with a mini-game involving the pick.

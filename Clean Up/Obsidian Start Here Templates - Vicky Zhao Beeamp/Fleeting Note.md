### What is a fleeting note? 
A thought that popped in your head which you decided to capture. These fleeting thoughts can happen as your conscious mind (e.g. while reading) or subconscious mind (e.g. while showering) processes and connects information. 


### How to write a fleeting note
- [ ] **Write down** your fleeting thought before it disappears (
- [ ] **Add tag(s)** to help your future self resurface this note (e.g. `#connect_to_other_notes` `#build_out_idea` `#implement_in_projectX` `#write_newsletter_on_idea`) 
- [ ] **Connect to other notes** in your vault (optional if you're vault is new. Tags are good enough to allow future connections)
- [ ] **Stretch your thinking** by using the [[Idea Compass]]

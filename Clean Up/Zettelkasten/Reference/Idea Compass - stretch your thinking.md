### What is an Idea Compass? 
The idea compass is a thinking tool that uses prompts represented by the directions West/East/North/South to help you stretch and deepen your thinking around an idea. 

*West: What's similar to this idea?*<br>
*East: What's opposite of this idea?*<br>
*North: Which theme / question does this idea come from?*<br>
*South: Where does this idea lead to? (So what?)*<br>


### How to use an idea compass
- [ ] **Write down** an idea
- [ ] **Pick one direction** to stretch you idea
      
*If you do NOT have any notes that are related ideas in that direction* 
- [ ] **Write out idea related to the prompt** to flesh out your thinking
- [ ] **Create a new note** to capture this new atomic idea you had!
- [ ] **Synthesize this idea** in one line and use as the title of your new note

*If you do have notes that contain related ideas in that direction*
- [ ] **Link the existing note** under the prompt
- [ ] **Write a quick explanation** of why the notes are related to your future self

- [ ] **Repeat with other directions** as needed (there is NO need to go all four directions in one sitting! Evolve your thinking overtime)
- [ ] **Add tag(s)** to help your future self resurface this note (e.g. #build_out_idea #write_newsletter_on_idea)

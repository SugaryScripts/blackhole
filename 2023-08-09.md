The dream involved Kaguya from an anime. In the dream, she witnessed the president's difficulties and how he grappled with an insurmountable task. This prompted her to secretly approach the president after going undercover. Along her journey, she unexpectedly encountered the president on the street. To her surprise, he was elated due to successfully conquering his challenges. He not only prevailed over the arduous task but also developed muscular strength. However, the muscles were unevenly distributed, with the left side being well-developed and the right side being notably thinner. The essential lesson from this dream is to never give up and to maintain consistency.

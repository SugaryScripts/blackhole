I found this thread while wanting folders that sort after Z in Finder on Mac OSX. After several false paths and trial and error, here's what I found:

Characters that sort after Z in Finder (in sort-order)

- z Lower case Z
- ι Greek letter
- Ι Greek letter, capital version of above character, not an "I")
- Ω Omega
- 一 Japanese Character? (Thanks, Jam)
- 口 Japanese character? (Thanks, Jam)
- 末 Japanese character "End" (Thanks, Jam)
-  (a private use character) (Thanks, Peter O.)

These are characters others here and in other places on the web, mentioned sort after Z, but that I found DO NOT sort at the end, at least when sorting by name in Finder on Mac:

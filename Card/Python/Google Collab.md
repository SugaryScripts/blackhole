# Case
## Exclamation mark '**!**'
**Key Differences:**
- **Environment:** Regular `pip install` interacts with your local system's package manager, while `!pip install` in Colab works within a temporary virtual environment for your notebook.
- **Persistence:** Packages installed with regular `pip install` persist on your local machine, whereas those installed with `!pip install` are temporary and disappear when you disconnect from your Colab session.
**Key Essence:**
Temporary install with `!pip install` and permanent install is `pip install`

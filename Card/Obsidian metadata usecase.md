I use metadata for three principal reasons.

First, is including background information about the note that I don't need to have in the body of the note itself, so that it is hidden except when needed. (Assuming that preview mode is the common mode for reading notes.) Simple examples would be `publication_date:` or `publication_source:`

Second is metadata such as `tags:` and `aliases:` that expose the note to other notes or to searches. `aliases:` is one of the most useful features in Obsidian, like a magic power that allows Obsidian to suggest backlinks in many different contexts to the note that has the aliases.

Third is metadata that exposes the note to Dataview queries.

**conclusion**
1. Hidden from preview
2. The uses of `aliases` that can be browsed/searched from many contexts
3. Dataview queries

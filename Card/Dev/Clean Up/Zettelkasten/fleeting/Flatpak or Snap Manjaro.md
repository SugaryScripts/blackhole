To enable the Flatpak and Snap package options in the Pamac UI, you need to ensure that you have the libpamac-flatpack-plugin and libpamac-snap-plugin installed on your system. You can install these plugins using the following commands or from Pamac user interface (software center):

`pamac install libpamac-flatpack-plugin`

`pamac install libbpamac-snap-plugin`

After those steps are completed restart Pamac and you should have the switches under third party settings.

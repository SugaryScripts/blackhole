### What is a literature note? 
An atomic idea extracted while consuming content (books, YouTube videos, podcasts, etc.), and rewritten in your own words to better process the idea. 

### How to write a literature note
- [ ] **Note down** an idea while you consume information
- [ ] **Rewrite the idea** in your own words in 3-5 sentences (writing is thinking) 
- [ ] **Record** the source for your future self to reference / dig deeper  
- [ ] **Add tag(s)** to help your future self resurface this note (e.g. `#connect_to_other_notes` `#build_out_idea` `#implement_in_projectX` `#write_newsletter_on_idea`) 
- [ ] **Connect to other notes** in your vault (optional if you're vault is new. Tags are good enough to allow future connections)
- [ ] **Stretch your thinking** by using the [[Idea Compass]]

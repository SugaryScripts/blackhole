### What is a permanent note? 
An atomic insight you generated from connecting your [[Fleeting Note]] / [[Literature Note]] / insight you have but are not yet captured in your note-taking system. 

### How to write a permanent note
- [ ] **Review** your [[Fleeting Note]] and [[Literature Note]] that have tags indicating they should be revisited (e.g. `#connect_to_other_notes` `#build_out_idea`) 
- [ ] **Develop and connect the idea** if you haven't already (e.g. use the [[Idea Compass]])
- [ ] **Add your personal take** by applying the idea to your personal anecdotes, experiences, areas of interest to see find potential surprising, contrarian insights
- [ ] **Synthesize your insight** in one line and use as the title of your new note
- [ ] **Add tag(s)** to help your future self resurface this note (e.g. `#write_newsletter_on_idea`)

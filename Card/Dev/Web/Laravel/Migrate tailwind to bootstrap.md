### Step 1: Install Laravel Jetstream

First, ensure you have Laravel and Jetstream installed. You can install Jetstream with either Livewire or Inertia.js. Here’s how you can install it with Livewire:

```bash
composer require laravel/jetstream
php artisan jetstream:install livewire
npm install && npm run dev
php artisan migrate
```

### Step 2: Remove Tailwind CSS

Remove Tailwind CSS from your project, as it's the default:

```bash
npm uninstall tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

Then, remove any Tailwind imports from your CSS files, typically found in `resources/css/app.css`.

### Step 3: Install Bootstrap

Install Bootstrap via npm:

```bash
npm install bootstrap
```

### Step 4: Include Bootstrap in Your Project

Import Bootstrap into your project. You can do this by adding the following line to your `resources/css/app.css` or create a new SCSS file if you prefer using SCSS:

```css
@import '~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```

Alternatively, for SCSS:

```scss
@import '~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap';
```

Then, update your `webpack.mix.js` to compile the new CSS:

```javascript
const mix = require('laravel-mix');

mix.js('resources/js/app.js', 'public/js')
    .postCss('resources/css/app.css', 'public/css', [
        //
    ]);
```

### Step 5: Adjust Your Views

You will need to update your Blade templates to use Bootstrap classes instead of Tailwind. This involves changing class names in the HTML structure of your Jetstream views, which can be found in `resources/views`.

### Step 6: Compile Assets

Run the following command to compile your assets:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 7: Test Your Application

Make sure to test your application thoroughly to ensure that all styles and scripts are loading correctly and that the UI looks as expected.

### Conclusion

This manual approach allows you to integrate Bootstrap into Laravel Jetstream, but it requires adjusting CSS classes in Blade views and might involve some additional tweaking to get everything looking just right. As of now, there isn't a direct, maintained package like JetStrap for newer versions of Laravel and Jetstream, so manual integration is the way to go.
